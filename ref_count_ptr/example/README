This directory contains working C++ code for the example programs
described in the RefCountPtr beginner's guide.  To build these
programs using g++ one just needs to set the environment variable
TRILINOS_BUILD to the base build directory containing a configured
version of the package Teuchos.

After setting the environment variable TRILINOS_BUILD, the original
example program that uses raw C++ pointers (and contains memory
deallocation errors) can be built from this directory as:

  make -f classicMakefile example_raw_cpp_pointers.exe

The refactored example program that uses RefCountPtr<> smart pointers
(which should be free of any memory deallocation problems) can be
built as:

  make -f classicMakefile example_ref_count_ptr.exe
